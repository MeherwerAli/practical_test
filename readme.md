You can run seeder to load Restaurant sample data by using following commands:
cd utils/seeders
node restaurantsSeeder.js --import

run the app after running the mongoDB on local

postman collection is with the project and swagger integration is also done.
Due to time I was not able to dockerize the application so that all the images can be used along with presetup db.
