In the terminal run the following command:
> npm install

You can run seeder to load Restaurant sample data by using following commands:
run the app after running the mongoDB on local
> cd utils/seeders
> node restaurantsSeeder.js --import

> npm start

postman collection is with the project and swagger integration is also done.
Due to time I was not able to dockerize the application so that all the images can be used along with presetup db.
